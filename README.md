# Traffic Light Classifier
This repository consists of my final project of Udacity's Intro to Self Driving Cars wherein the three traffic lights consisting of red, green and yellow colors are identified and an image label is predicted for the test images which predict the colour of the light.
Open CV has been used for feature extraction and visualization, the output results in 92.59% accuracy with a further room for incdreasing it by an improved algorithm
